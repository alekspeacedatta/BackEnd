        Everything in this Universe carries a vibration, including the words that you speak.

        For centuries, people have used words for healing.
        Words can be used to share a story, they can be used to pray and they can be used to express a deeper truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way words can be used for healing is through mantras. Mantras are short, positively inspired phrases that carry
        a powerful healing vibration and can help to free your body, mind, and soul of any stresses.
    </p>
    <p>
        The word mantra loosely translates to “instrument of the mind”. This is because mantras have the power to transform your thinking, and rewire thought
        patterns and belief systems that have been ingrained deep within your subconscious.
